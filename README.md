I worked to create several data visualisations to give insight into the world of roller coasters (wood and steel):

* The ranking of a given roller coaster over time as a line;

* The ranking of two given roller coasters over time as lines;

* The ranking of the top `n` ranked roller coasters over time as lines;

* A histogram of any numeric column;

* A bar chart showing the number of inversions for each roller coaster at an amusement park;

* A pie chart that compares the number of operating roller coasters to the number of closed roller coasters creates a scatter plot of two numeric columns.
